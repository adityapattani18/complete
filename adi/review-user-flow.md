Thought for 13 seconds

Below is a **walk-through** of what that interaction looks like end-to-end—both the user-facing chat/UI and the behind-the-scenes routing + database writes. We’ll assume:

- You’ve created three agents in your `agents` table:
  1. **mapbox** (for map rendering)
  2. **browser_use** (for any web scraping/news lookups)
  3. **risk_calc** (your “generate tool” that crunches geopolitical risk)
  4. **foursquare** (for POI lookup)
- You’ve got a new `chat_topics` row (call it `topic_id = 123`) for this session.

## 1) User says “init” + origin/destination

### Chat Transcript

```
SYSTEM ▶ How can I help today?
USER   ▶ init
SYSTEM ▶ Got it—starting a new shipment session. Where are we shipping from and to?
USER   ▶ From Jebel Ali to Houston.
```

### Routing

- The user’s “From Jebel Ali to Houston” is auto-routed to the **mapbox** agent.

### DB Writes

```sql
-- 1. Record the user message
INSERT INTO chat_messages
  (topic_id, user_id, role, content, agent_id)
VALUES
  (123, 7, 'user', 'From Jebel Ali to Houston.',
   (SELECT id FROM agents WHERE key = 'mapbox'));

-- 2. Record the assistant’s Mapbox response
INSERT INTO chat_messages
  (topic_id, user_id, role, content, model_name, agent_id)
VALUES
  (123, 7, 'assistant',
   'Here’s a map showing Jebel Ali → Houston: [embedded Mapbox iframe]',
   NULL, (SELECT id FROM agents WHERE key = 'mapbox'));
```

---

## 2) “Check all the routes between the two stops”

### Chat Transcript

```
USER   ▶ Show me all possible sea routes.
```

### Routing

- This query goes to **browser_use** , which programmatically visits route-aggregator sites (e.g., marine-traffic.com) and scrapes the list of shipping lanes.

### DB Writes

```sql
INSERT INTO chat_messages
  (topic_id, user_id, role, content, agent_id)
VALUES
  (123, 7, 'user', 'Show me all possible sea routes.',
   (SELECT id FROM agents WHERE key = 'browser_use'));

INSERT INTO chat_messages
  (topic_id, user_id, role, content, model_name, agent_id)
VALUES
  (123, 7, 'assistant',
   'I found three common routes:\n1) Suez Canal → Atlantic\n2) Cape of Good Hope\n3) Around Africa → Atlantic',
   'gpt-4.1', (SELECT id FROM agents WHERE key = 'browser_use'));
```

---

## 3) “For each route, check ports along the way via Foursquare”

### Chat Transcript

```
USER   ▶ For each route, list major port stops with Foursquare.
```

### Routing

- Sent to the **foursquare** agent, which uses the Foursquare Places API to pull ports near each leg.

### DB Writes

```sql
INSERT INTO chat_messages
  (topic_id, user_id, role, content, agent_id)
VALUES
  (123, 7, 'user',
   'For each route, list major port stops with Foursquare.',
   (SELECT id FROM agents WHERE key = 'foursquare'));

INSERT INTO chat_messages
  (topic_id, user_id, role, content, model_name, agent_id)
VALUES
  (123, 7, 'assistant',
   'Here are the stops:\n• Route 1: Port Said, Gibraltar\n• Route 2: Cape Town, Walvis Bay\n• Route 3: Durban, Recife',
   'gpt-4.1', (SELECT id FROM agents WHERE key = 'foursquare'));
```

---

## 4) “Check latest news on each port”

### Chat Transcript

```
USER   ▶ Get me the latest news on each of those ports.
```

### Routing

- Routed again to **browser_use** , now targeting news sites (e.g., Google News, local newspapers).

### DB Writes

```sql
INSERT INTO chat_messages
  (topic_id, user_id, role, content, agent_id)
VALUES
  (123, 7, 'user',
   'Get me the latest news on each of those ports.',
   (SELECT id FROM agents WHERE key = 'browser_use'));

INSERT INTO chat_messages
  (topic_id, user_id, role, content, model_name, agent_id)
VALUES
  (123, 7, 'assistant',
   'Port Said: “New labor strike delays loading at Port Said”\nGibraltar: “Naval exercises nearby raise congestion concerns”\n…',
   'gpt-4.1', (SELECT id FROM agents WHERE key = 'browser_use'));
```

---

## 5) “Calculate risk along these POIs”

### Chat Transcript

```
USER   ▶ Calculate geopolitical risk for each port.
```

### Routing

- Sent to your **risk_calc** tool (the “generate” agent), which ingests the port list + news and outputs a risk score.

### DB Writes

```sql
INSERT INTO chat_messages
  (topic_id, user_id, role, content, agent_id)
VALUES
  (123, 7, 'user',
   'Calculate geopolitical risk for each port.',
   (SELECT id FROM agents WHERE key = 'risk_calc'));

INSERT INTO chat_messages
  (topic_id, user_id, role, content, model_name, agent_id)
VALUES
  (123, 7, 'assistant',
   'Risk Scores:\n• Port Said: 7.2/10 (strike risk)\n• Gibraltar: 5.8/10 (military drills)\n…',
   'gpt-4.1', (SELECT id FROM agents WHERE key = 'risk_calc'));
```

---

### Putting it all together

Now a **single SQL query** fetches the entire session in order, with each message tagged by the agent that handled it:

```sql
SELECT role,
       content,
       model_name,
       a.key    AS agent,
       created_at
  FROM chat_messages m
  LEFT JOIN agents a ON m.agent_id = a.id
 WHERE m.topic_id = 123
 ORDER BY m.created_at;
```

| role      | content                                                | model_name | agent       | created_at          |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- | ----------- | ------------------- |
| user      | From Jebel Ali to Houston.                             |            | mapbox      | 2025-04-24 06:05:12 |
| assistant | Mapbox embed → shows both points                       |            | mapbox      | 2025-04-24 06:05:15 |
| user      | Show me all possible sea routes.                       |            | browser_use | 2025-04-24 06:06:00 |
| assistant | “I found three common routes…”                         | gpt-4.1    | browser_use | 2025-04-24 06:06:30 |
| user      | For each route, list major port stops with Foursquare. |            | foursquare  | 2025-04-24 06:07:10 |
| assistant | “Here are the stops: Port Said, Gibraltar…”            | gpt-4.1    | foursquare  | 2025-04-24 06:07:45 |
| user      | Get me the latest news on each of those ports.         |            | browser_use | 2025-04-24 06:08:05 |
| assistant | “Port Said: …”                                         | gpt-4.1    | browser_use | 2025-04-24 06:08:40 |
| user      | Calculate geopolitical risk for each port.             |            | risk_calc   | 2025-04-24 06:09:00 |
| assistant | “Risk Scores: Port Said 7.2/10…”                       | gpt-4.1    | risk_calc   | 2025-04-24 06:09:30 |

This gives you a **clean, ordered history** of:

1. **Who said what** (`role`)
2. **Which agent** handled each turn (`agent`)
3. **When** it happened (`created_at`)

—and a turnkey pipeline from **“init” → map → route scraping → POI lookup → news fetch → risk calc** all in one coherent chat session.
